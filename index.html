<hr><p>In data centers, the electricity price from the grid is not fixed and the stored energy device can be used to power the data center up when the price of the electricity from the grid is expensive. By using such kind of devices in a proper way, we can achieve a optimal power cost in data centers. This paper mainly focuses on how to utilize the stored energy device optimally without knowing any knowledge of the statistics of the work-load and the electricity cost processes. </p>

<p>The formulation for this model is easy. However, it tends to be a stochastic optimization problem and quite difficult to solve. The decision must be made online. Actually, what the most useful technique I learn from this paper is the Lyapunov optimization. At the first sight, I don't know what is the reason why the authors solve P3 as P3 is not slightly different from the original problem. It turns out that by solving 
P3, a good control policy can be obtained and the performance is guaranteed by Lyapunov optimization. </p>

<p>The Lyapunov optimization is really powerful, I appreciate it a lot as I have a better understanding of applying it in my own research. </p>
